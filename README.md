An engaging computer graphics project that simulates interactive rain, dynamic water waves, and a visually enriched environment. Built using **OpenGL**, this project showcases concepts of real-time graphics rendering, animations, and user interaction.

## Features
- **Dynamic Rain**: Raindrops fall interactively when dragging the mouse.
- **Floating Boat**: A boat oscillates naturally with the water waves.
- **Wave Animation**: Smooth, continuous wave motion that reacts to water height.
- **Interactive Environment**:
  - A house, trees, clouds, and a mountain as background elements.
  - A dynamically rising water level affected by rain.
- **Weather System**:
  - Realistic water ripples and splashes as rain hits the surface.
  - Clouds move across the sky to simulate natural motion.
  
## Technologies Used
- **C++**: Core programming language.
- **OpenGL**: Graphics library for rendering and animation.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iMD10/CS341-Rainy-Day.git
   cd CS341-Rainy-Day
2. Compile the main program (RainyDay.cpp) using your C++ compiler with OpenGL support:
   ```bash
   g++ -o rainy_day RainyDay.cpp -lGL -lGLU -lglut
   ```
3. Run the program:
    ```bash
    ./rainy_day
    ```
4. Interact with the simulation:
    - Drag the mouse to generate rain dynamically.
    - Observe the rising water level and wave animations.
    - Watch the boat float and oscillate with the waves.

## Learning Objectives
This project is part of a Computer Graphics Course to explore:

  - Real-time rendering using OpenGL.
  - Animation techniques such as sine wave motion.
  - User interaction to trigger dynamic simulations.
  - Building immersive environments with natural elements like rain, water, and waves.
