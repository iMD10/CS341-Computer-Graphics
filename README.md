# Interactive Rain Simulation with Waves üåßÔ∏è

An engaging computer graphics project that simulates interactive rain, dynamic water waves, and a visually enriched environment. Built using **OpenGL**, this project showcases concepts of real-time graphics rendering, animations, and user interaction.

## Features
- **Dynamic Rain**: Raindrops fall interactively when dragging the mouse.
- **Floating Boat**: A boat oscillates naturally with the water waves.
- **Wave Animation**: Smooth, continuous wave motion that reacts to water height.
- **Interactive Environment**:
  - A house, trees, clouds, and a mountain as background elements.
  - A dynamically rising water level affected by rain.
- **Weather System**:
  - Realistic water ripples and splashes as rain hits the surface.
  - Clouds move across the sky to simulate natural motion.
  
## Technologies Used
- **C++**: Core programming language.
- **OpenGL**: Graphics library for rendering and animation.
